    <p class='padding'> The air transport industry plays a major role in world economic activity. One of the key elements to maintaining the vitality of civil aviation is to ensure safe, secure, efficient and environmentally sustainable operations at the global, regional and national levels.
	</p>
    <p class='padding'>International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) was created to promote the safe and orderly development of international civil aviation throughout the world.
	</p>
     <p class='padding'> ICAO sets the Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) necessary for aviation safety, security, efficiency and environmental protection on a global basis. ICAO serves as the primary forum for co-operation in all fields of civil aviation among its 191 Member States.
	 </p>
     <p class='padding'>Improving the safety of the global air transport system is ICAOâ€™s guiding and most fundamental Strategic Objective. The Organization works constantly to address and enhance global aviation safety through the following coordinated activities.
	 </p>
     <p class='padding'>In USOAP most of the country failed to manage their inspection and auditing procedure for their Pilots, Aircrafts, Organization, and Training & System. So our mission is to establish aviation safety issue and functions of Civil Aviation Authority digitally. This system is built to design for maintaining Civil Aviation Authority of any country, any regulation & any standards.
